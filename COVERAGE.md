make coverage-check

# Or check custom threshold
python scripts/coverage.py --check 85
```

## 🎮 Simple Command Interface

Use the convenient shell script for all coverage operations:

```bash
# Complete coverage analysis
./scripts/run-coverage.sh

# Quick check
./scripts/run-coverage.sh quick

# Watch mode
./scripts/run-coverage.sh watch

# Open dashboard
./scripts/run-coverage.sh dashboard

# Check requirements
./scripts/run-coverage.sh check 85

## 🎯 Coverage Targets and Goals

### Coverage Levels
- **🟢 Excellent**: 90-100% coverage
- **🟡 Good**: 80-89% coverage  
- **🟠 Needs Work**: 70-79% coverage
- **🔴 Poor**: <70% coverage

### Project Goals
- **Overall Target**: 80%+ coverage
- **Critical Functions**: 95%+ coverage (auth, story generation, payments)
- **New Code**: 90%+ coverage
- **Bug Fixes**: 100% coverage of fix and regression tests

### File-Level Monitoring
The system tracks coverage for:
- ✅ API endpoints (`main.py`, route handlers)
- ✅ Business logic (`story_generation.py`, `avatar_creation.py`)
- ✅ Authentication (`auth/`)
- ✅ Database operations (`core/database.py`)
- ✅ Utility functions (`auth/auth_utils.py`)
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

## 🔄 Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Hooks
Add coverage check to your git hooks:
```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
python scripts/coverage.py --check 80
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Coverage below 80%. Please add tests before committing."
    exit 1
fi
```

### IDE Integration
Most IDEs can integrate with coverage reports:
- **VS Code**: Use Coverage Gutters extension with `coverage.xml`
- **PyCharm**: Built-in coverage support with pytest-cov
- **Vim/Neovim**: Use coverage.py with ale or similar plugins

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    make coverage
    python scripts/coverage.py --check 80

- name: Upload coverage reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: coverage-report
    path: coverage_reports/
```

## 📈 Understanding Coverage Metrics

### What Coverage Measures
- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of code lines executed by tests
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of code branches (if/else) tested
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions called by tests

### What Coverage Doesn't Measure
- **Test Quality**: High coverage doesn't guarantee good tests
- **Edge Cases**: Coverage doesn't show if all scenarios are tested
- **Integration**: Unit test coverage may miss integration issues

### Best Practices
1. **Aim for 80%+ overall coverage**
2. **Focus on critical business logic**
3. **Test error conditions and edge cases**
4. **Use coverage to find untested code, not as the only quality metric**
5. **Combine with code review and integration testing**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Coverage reports empty or missing:**
```bash
# Clean and regenerate
make clean
make coverage
```

**Watch mode not working:**
```bash
# Install watchdog dependency
pip install watchdog

# Check file permissions
chmod +x scripts/coverage-watch.py
```

**Dashboard not loading:**
```bash
# Regenerate dashboard
python scripts/coverage-dashboard.py

# Open directly
open coverage_reports/dashboard.html
```

**Low coverage percentage:**
1. Run full analysis: `make coverage`
2. Open HTML report: `open coverage_reports/html/index.html`
3. Look for red highlighted lines
4. Write tests for untested code
5. Re-run coverage to verify improvement

### Performance Tips

**Speed up coverage runs:**
- Use `make coverage-quick` for frequent checks
- Use `pytest-xdist` for parallel test execution
- Focus on specific test files: `pytest tests/test_specific.py --cov=src`

**Reduce noise in reports:**
- Exclude test files from coverage: `--cov-report=term --cov=src`
- Use `.coveragerc` to exclude specific files or lines

## 🤝 Contributing to Test Coverage

When adding new features or fixing bugs:

1. **Before coding**: Check current coverage
2. **While coding**: Use watch mode for real-time feedback
3. **After coding**: Ensure coverage maintains or improves
4. **Before PR**: Run full coverage analysis and check requirements

Remember: **Good tests with high coverage = Reliable, maintainable code!** 🚀
